passwdtools.com
===============

Source code for passwdtools.com. I needed a tool that could quickly and easily
generate secure difficult-to-remember (API keys, encryption salts for apps) and
easy-to-remember (every day needs) passwords. The current online tools either
don't do the job, or don't do it well so this is my version of what I believe
should be used.
